# Applied-Data-Science-with-Python_Coursera
Stage II for Python Learning

This repo consists of assignments and various projects which i came across in this course. Whole specialization is a new level of Learning for Python (Comparing to Python for everybody specialization), consists of 4 courses and a capstone project.
This course is from University of Michigan by various Instructors as Christopher Brooks, V. G. Vinod Vydiswaran, Kevyn Collins-Thompson, Daniel Romero.

The 5 courses in this University of Michigan specialization introduce learners to data science through the python programming language. This skills-based specialization is intended for learners who have a basic python or programming background, and want to apply statistical, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis techniques through popular python toolkits such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networkx to gain insight into their data.

Introduction to Data Science in Python (course 1), Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python (course 2), and Applied Machine Learning in Python (course 3) should be taken in order and prior to any other course in the specialization.
